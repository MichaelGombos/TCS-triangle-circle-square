/*

I need to be able to click on a card to select it

With the card selected, I should be able to click a box on the field to set the card

If a card is placed on the field, It will be "used" and unable to be selected until the location is clicked again to remove this card

Once all three spots are chosen, the results of the round will be generated

Fow now, I will ignore building a CPU and use a pregenerated list of rounds.
